# react-native-qrcode-scanner
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-qrcode-scanner.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-qrcode-scanner)

A QR code scanner component for React Native built on top of [react-native-camera by Lochlan Wansbrough](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera)


Please note, this will also function as a generic barcode scanner by the virtue of the above module supporting barcode scanning, however, this module was initially built as a QR code scanner.

I wrote this module because I couldn't find one that could be simply plugged into a project without requiring too much setup. 

Looking for active contributors (if you're interested, reach out to me at moaazsidat@gmail.com)

## Getting started

### Requirements

#### iOS 10
With iOS 10 and higher you need to add the "Privacy - Camera Usage Description" key to the info.plist of your project. This should be found in 'your_project/ios/your_project/Info.plist'.  Add the following code:
  ```
  <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your message to user when the camera is accessed for the first time</string>

  <!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the camera roll -->
  <key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your message to user when the photo library is accessed for the first time</string>

  <!-- Include this only if you are planning to use the microphone for video recording -->
  <key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
  <string>Your message to user when the microsphone is accessed for the first time</string>
```
#### Android 7
With Android 7 and higher you need to add the "Vibration" permission to your AndroidManifest.xml of your project. This should be found in your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` Add the following:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>
```

#### react-native-camera
[react-native-camera](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera) is a dependency for this package that you'll need to add to your project. To install, run the following commands:
  1. `npm install react-native-camera --save`
  2. `react-native link react-native-camera`
 
#### New Version/Migration
If using an older version of this module with RCTCamera you will need to follow the docs [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-camera/blob/master/docs/migration.md) to move from the old RCTCamera to the new RNCamera. You will then need to install it as above. 

**Versions of this library > 0.0.30 will not support react-native-camera versions less than 1.0.0.**

### To install and start using react-native-qrcode-scanner:
```
npm install react-native-qrcode-scanner --save
```
```
react-native link react-native-qrcode-scanner
react-native link react-native-permissions
```

## Usage
To use react-native-qrcode-scanner, `import` the `react-native-qrcode-scanner` module and use the `<QRCodeScanner />` tag. More usage examples can be seen under the `examples/` folder.

Here is an example of basic usage:
```js
'use strict';

import React, { Component } from 'react';

import {
  AppRegistry,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  TouchableOpacity,
  Linking,
} from 'react-native';

import QRCodeScanner from 'react-native-qrcode-scanner';

class ScanScreen extends Component {
  onSuccess(e) {
    Linking
      .openURL(e.data)
      .catch(err => console.error('An error occured', err));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <QRCodeScanner
        onRead={this.onSuccess.bind(this)}
        topContent={
          <Text style={styles.centerText}>
            Go to <Text style={styles.textBold}>wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code</Text> on your computer and scan the QR code.
          </Text>
        }
        bottomContent={
          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.buttonTouchable}>
            <Text style={styles.buttonText}>OK. Got it!</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        }
      />
    );
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  centerText: {
    flex: 1,
    fontSize: 18,
    padding: 32,
    color: '#777',
  },
  textBold: {
    fontWeight: '500',
    color: '#000',
  },
  buttonText: {
    fontSize: 21,
    color: 'rgb(0,122,255)',
  },
  buttonTouchable: {
    padding: 16,
  },
});

AppRegistry.registerComponent('default', () => ScanScreen);
```

## Methods

#### `reactivate()`

Call this method to programmatically enabling scanning again. Use this by attaching a `ref` like so `<QRCodeScanner ref={(node) => { this.scanner = node }}>` and calling `this.scanner.reactivate()`

## Props

#### `onRead` (required)
propType: `func.isRequired`
default: `(e) => (console.log('QR code scanned!', e))`

Will call this specified method when a QR code or a barcode is detected in the camera's view passing in the event emitted upon reading the code.

#### `fadeIn`
propType: `bool`
default: `true`

When set to `true` this ensures that the camera view fades in after the initial load up instead of being rendered immediately.
Set this to false to prevent the animated fade in of the camera view.

#### `vibrate`
propType: `bool`
default: `true`

Use this to disable vibration.

#### `reactivate`
propType: `bool`
default: `false`

When set to `false`,  when a QR code is scanned, the `QRCodeScanner` will not scan another code until it is re-rendered.
When set to `true` this will reactivate the scanning ability of the component.

#### `reactivateTimeout`
propType: `number`
default: `0`

Use this to configure how long it should take before the `QRCodeScanner` should reactivate.

#### `topContent`
propType: `oneOfType([
  PropTypes.element,
  PropTypes.string,
])`

Use this to render any additional content at the top of the camera view.

#### `bottomContent`
propType: `oneOfType([
  PropTypes.element,
  PropTypes.string,
])`

Use this to render any additional content at the bottom of the camera view.

#### `containerStyle`
propType: `any`

Use this to pass styling for the outermost container. Useful for adding margin/padding to account for navigation bar. 

#### `cameraStyle`
propType: `any`

Use this to pass or overwrite styling for the camera window rendered.

#### `topViewStyle`
propType: `any`

Use this to pass or overwrite styling for the `<View>` that contains the `topContent` prop.

#### `bottomViewStyle`
propType: `any`

Use this to pass or overwrite styling for the `<View>` that contains the `bottomContent` prop.

#### `showMarker` 
propType: `boolean`
default: `false`

Use this to show marker on the camera scanning window

#### `customMarker`
propType: `element`

Pass a RN element/component to use it as a custom marker.

#### `notAuthorizedView`
propType: `element`

Pass a RN element/component to use it when no permissions given to the camera (iOS only).

#### `cameraType`
propType: `oneOf(['front', 'back'])`
default: `'back'`

Use this to control which camera to use for scanning QR codes, defaults to rear camera. 

#### `checkAndroid6Permissions`
propType: `bool`
default: `false`

Use this to enable permission checking on Android 6

#### `permissionDialogTitle`
propType: `string`

## Thanks
Thanks to [Lochlan Wansbrough](https://github.com/lwansbrough) for the [react-native-camera module](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera) which provided me with an awesome example of how to set up this module.

This QR code scanner was inspired by the QR code scanner within [Whatsapp](https://www.whatsapp.com/).


## Other notes

### To do
- Document other complex examples
- Add some tests
